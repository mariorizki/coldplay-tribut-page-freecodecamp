          <strong>Coldplay</strong> are a British rock band formed in London in
          1996. Vocalist, rhythm guitarist and pianist Chris Martin, lead
          guitarist Jonny Buckland, bassist Guy Berryman, and drummer Will
          Champion met at University College London and began playing music
          together from 1996 to 1998, first calling themselves Pectoralz and
          then Starfish before finally changing their name to Coldplay. Their
          creative director and former manager Phil Harvey is considered the
          fifth member of the band.

          After changing their name to Coldplay, the band recorded and released
          two EPs: Safety in 1998 and The Blue Room in 1999. The latter was
          their first release on a major record label, after signing to
          Parlophone. Coldplay achieved worldwide fame with the release of the
          song "Yellow" in 2000, followed in the same year by their debut album
          Parachutes, which was nominated for the Mercury Prize. The band's
          second album, A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002), was released to
          critical acclaim. Their next release, X&Y, was the best-selling album
          worldwide of 2005. Their Brian Eno-produced fourth studio album, Viva
          la Vida or Death and All His Friends (2008) was the best-selling album
          worldwide of said year and earned three Grammy Awards. In 2011,
          Coldplay released their fifth studio album, Mylo Xyloto, which topped
          the charts in over 34 countries and was the UK's best-selling rock
          album of 2011. The band have since released Ghost Stories (2014), A
          Head Full of Dreams (2015) and Everyday Life (2019).

        <p>
          Coldplay have sold more than 100 million records worldwide, making
          them one of the world's best-selling music artists. They have won
          numerous awards throughout their career, including nine Brit Awards,
          seven MTV Video Music Awards, eight MTV Europe Music Awards and seven
          Grammy Awards from 35 nominations. The band's first three albums —
          Parachutes (2000), A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002), and X&Y (2005)
          — are among the best-selling albums in UK chart history. In December
          2009, Rolling Stone readers voted the group the fourth-best artist of
          the 2000s, and Q magazine included the group in their Artists of the
          Century list.

          Coldplay have supported various social and political causes, such as
          Oxfam's Make Trade Fair campaign and Amnesty International. They have
          also performed at charity projects, including Band Aid 20, Live 8,
          Global Citizen Festival, Sound Relief, Hope for Haiti Now: A Global
          Benefit for Earthquake Relief, One Love Manchester, The Secret
          Policeman's Ball, Sport Relief and the UK Teenage Cancer Trust.
